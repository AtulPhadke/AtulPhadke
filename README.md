## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Atul Phadke, a Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. I build AI-driven biomedical software, fullâ€‘stack applications, and advanced analysis pipelines. I'm currently a 2nd year applying to co-ops for the January - June cycle. I'm also interested in summer internships.

Iâ€™m excited about problems at the intersection of biotechnology and computer science and enjoy shipping reliable, scalable tools that accelerate research and discovery.

My portfolio is at: [AtulPhadke.github.io/portfolio](AtulPhadke.github.io/portfolio)
