## Hi there 👋

I’m Atul Phadke, a Computer Science and Behavioral Neuroscience student at Northeastern University. I build AI-driven biomedical software, full‑stack applications, and advanced analysis pipelines. I'm currently a 2nd year applying to co-ops for the January - June cycle. I'm also interested in summer internships.

I’m excited about problems at the intersection of biotechnology and computer science and enjoy shipping reliable, scalable tools that accelerate research and discovery.

My portfolio is at: [atulphadke.github.io/portfolio](https://atulphadke.github.io/portfolio)
